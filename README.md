## About
This game was inspired from [ShapeShiftGames](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU7_3ilz6zICwzulRldZuSQ) by john & some assets are used like sound & animation, but code is fully written by me and currently I'm learning unity and new to C# so there maybe some errors & many warnings but I will fix them *ASAP*..
## Tools Used

 - Unity as Game Engine.
 - IntelliJ's Rider for C# scripting.
 - Audacity for Sound Enhancements.
